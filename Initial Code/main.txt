//

I should have creeps just to harvest and drop
have carrying creeps to search for dropped energy and transfer to spawn or extension
    - do you think this is better than actually going to the creeps?
        - well, at least the harvestor doesn't have to wait for someone to come pick up their stuff
    - use the memory for this

currently, the miners are carrying 100 and dropping only 50 to the extension, and returning to mine
    - use the memory to see if it's was dropping previously or mining
    
oh and up resource is resource[0]
